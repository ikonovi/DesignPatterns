	Design patterns are reusable solutions that solve the challenges software developers face over and over again. 
Rather than reinventing the wheel, learn how to make use of these proven and tested patterns 
that will make your software more reliable and flexible to change.
	This course will introduce you to design patterns and take you through seven of 
the most used object-oriented patterns that will make your development faster and easier. 
	Elisabeth Robson and Eric Freeman, coauthors of Head First Design Patterns, 
join forces to provide an overview of each pattern and examples of the pattern in action. 
Featured design patterns include the strategy, observer, decorator, singleton, collection, state, 
and factory method patterns.


MY NOTES: 

	Design Principle #1 - “Encapsulate What Varies”
Identify the aspects of your code that vary and separate them
from what stays the same. 
a shorthand for this principle - that is, "Encapsulate What Varies". 
	- If some aspect of code is changing: That’s a sign you should pull it out and separate it
	- By separating out the parts of your code that vary, you can extend or alter them without affecting the rest of
your code.
	- This principle is fundamental to almost every design Pattern.
All patterns let some part of the code vary independently of other parts




	Design Principle #5 - "Open-Close"
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

	The Decorator Pattern 
attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub classing for extending functionality.			

	The Singleton Pattern 
ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it.
